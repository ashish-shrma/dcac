To maximise the spread of information regarding the events organised by the Alumni Association, an e-mail account was created in December 2012. The existing database of 600+ alumni which existed in hard-copies was saved in the Microsoft Excel format for easy updating in future.<br><br>

Several emails were sent to the alumni. The details of the emails sent to them are as follows:<br><br>

<font color="#007229 "><strong><u>Database Update</u></strong></font><br><br>
E-mails were sent to the alumni requesting them to send their details (as per the Registration Form). Those alumni whose email addresses were unavailable with us were contacted via SMS and requested to send their information on our e-mail account. We received responses from many alumni.<br><br>

Those whose information was not received were sent individual e-mails and were also contacted by phone. As a result, before the 3rd Alumni Meet we had complete information of 700+ alumni.<br><br> 

<font color="#007229 "><strong><u>Greetings </u></strong></font><br><br>
On 1st January 2013, a New Year greeting e-mail card was sent to all the alumni and an SMS was also sent. Along with the greetings, the alumni were also intimated about the date of the Alumni Meet dinner in February. <br><br>

Contact was also initiated with Radio Mirchi to publicize the event and with our alumni from the Taj Group of Hotels. We also contacted Times of India and Hindustan Times for print media publicity. However, media publicity could not be implemented because of lack of funds.<br><br> 

We received a positive response from an international student and many other alumni. In this regard, the Association sent information regarding the bank details for online money transfer.<br><br>

<font color="#007229 "><strong><u>Faculty contact</u></strong></font><br><br>
